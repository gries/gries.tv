About me

    “The function of good software is to make the complex appear to be simple.” (Grady Booch)

I'm a young aspiring software-engineer who's passion is writing high quality code. I love takeling highly complex tasks and breaking them down into small pieces of reusable code.

My other passions include IT-Security, playing and extending Minecraft and making music.
